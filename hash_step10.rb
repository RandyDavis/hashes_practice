# TODO: Did you know that hashes can accept anything as a key and anything
# as a value? Try atleast 5 different combinations of key/values
# using different data types. Example: hash = {4.5 => :my_symbol}

hash = { "Randy" => :name, 34 => :age, ["cheese", "sausage", "pepperoni"] => :ingredients, :state => "Texas", "Monday" => :day_of_week }
